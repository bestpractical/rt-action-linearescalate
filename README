RT::Action::LinearEscalate(3)



NAME
         RT::Action::LinearEscalate

DESCRIPTION
       LinearEscalate is a ScripAction which is NOT intended to be called per
       transaction. It's intended to be called by an RT escalation tool.  One
       such tool is called rt-crontool and is located in $RTHOME/bin (see
       "rt-crontool -h" for more details)

       This ScripAction will move a ticket's priority from its initial prior-
       ity to its final priority linearly as the ticket approaches its due
       date.

       This ScripAction uses RT's internal Ticket::_Set call to set ticket
       priority without running scrips or recording a transaction on each
       update.

       To install this package:

        # perl Makefile.PL
        # make install

       Once the ScripAction is installed, the following script in "cron" will
       get tickets to where they need to be:

        rt-crontool --search RT::Search::FromSQL --search-arg \
           "(Status='new' OR Status='open' OR Status = 'stalled')" \
           --action RT::Action::LinearEscalate
