 *	Hi, Jesse.  I've been working on RT a bit lately, and fixed a bug in
	the RT-Action-LinearEscalate extention.  It will fail if the due date
	is before the created date.  This happened to us when a user created a
	ticket with the current date as the due date.  This give a due date
	with the clock part set to 0:0:0, and thus a due timestamp before the
	created timestamp.
	
	This patch fixed the problem by making sure such due date is ignored
	when calculating priorities.  It also fixes a potential problem
	(divison by zero) if the due and created date ended up as the same
	value.
	
	I also added some logging, to make sure it is possible to figure it
	out in the log when tickets was silently escalated.
